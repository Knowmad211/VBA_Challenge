# VBA_Challenge

My Solution.vba file was created with help from our class files and examples, collaboration with classmates, and mostly with help through the my BootCampSpot Tutor Simon Rennocks. He helped me work through my issues, and provided advice on cleaning up my script and how to make it more efficient. 
All source files are in the class repository.
